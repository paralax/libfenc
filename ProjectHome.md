libfenc is an extensible library implementing several functional encryption schemes.  Functional encryption is a new class of encryption that includes Attribute-Based and Identity-based encryption.

At present the library implements a few ABE schemes such as the Lewko-Sahai-Waters scheme from IEEE S&P (Oakland) 2010 and the Waters Ciphertext-policy scheme from 2008.

The current version of the library uses some code from John Bethencourt's CP-ABE library.

The library is currently in a pre-release demonstration phase, and contains a number of known issues.  You can download the code via SVN and see the release notes on the Wiki.  If you'd like to use libfenc for a specific application or research project and have questions, please contact the author(s):
